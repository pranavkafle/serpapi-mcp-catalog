# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve the SerpApi MCP catalog.

## Guidelines

- Keep JSON changes minimal and consistent with existing structure.
- Prefer doc-backed updates; include source links when possible.
- Run the sync script after catalog updates:

```
python scripts/sync-catalog.py
```

## Reporting issues

Please include the engine name, the parameter in question, and a link to the official SerpApi documentation.
